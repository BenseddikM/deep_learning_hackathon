# deep_learning_hackathon

Hackathon solution for morpho's challenge on classifying face images for people's gender (male/female/not recognised).

Open the .ipynb file to access the notebook. The data is not uploaded in the repo because of its size.

Used Tensorflow CNN architecture (dropout, conv layers, batch norm and pooling) for first attempt.

Used Keras model with similar architecture for simpler coding solution.

Gradient descent results on the end of the notebook.
